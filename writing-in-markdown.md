Writing in Markdown
======

from https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics

##Paragraph
Paragraphs are just one or more consecutive text followed by one or two blank lines.

*This is just another paragraph.*

##Heading
Adding \# befor the heading text, the number of \# determines the heading of the text.

##Blockquotes
Like email, adding > before text indicates blockquotes.

> less is more.

##Styling text
\* or \_ surrounded text has style. One \* or \_ indicates *italic*(em) while two or more means __bold__(strong).

##List
* Adding \* or \- before text will make unordered list.
* Adding number following a dot before text will make ordered list.

##Link
Wrap link text in brackets \[\] and link address in parenthesis just follow the brackets.
